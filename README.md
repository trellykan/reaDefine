reaDefine "redefines" reading by generating a vocabulary list of new words for you to learn! It can also generate a quiz to help you stay on top of the new words.

Our project reads and processes a text file, creates a list of vocabulary words from the text file, defines these words, generates a quiz for the list, and displays the score at the end. When parsing the text file, we use a list of the 1000 most common english words to remove them from the vocabulary list and we also remove duplicate words. We then use the Merriam Webster API to define the words. If a word has no definition, the user is prompted to add a definition. Once the vocabulary list is complete, the program can then generate a quiz from the vocabulary list.
